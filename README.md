# City-Rides-Platform-Dashboard-Excel-Project-
### Project Overview
This project analyzes a fictional ride-sharing dataset to extract insights on revenue, ride behavior and driver performance using Excel. It replicates a real-world data analytics task often given in business intelligence roles.
### Objective
To explore and visualize ride-sharing across different cities, drivers and fare, and to uncover insights that can help businesss stakeholders improve decision making regarding:
        â€¢ 	Ride activity and revenue trends
	â€¢	Effectiveness of promo codes
	â€¢	Driver performance
	â€¢	Driver performance by city
	â€¢	Ride status performance (Active vs Inactive)
 ### ðŸ§¾ Dataset Summary
  Two datasets were used:
	â€¢	Rides_Data: Contains ride-level data including fare, distance, duration, promo code, ride status, city, and rating.
	â€¢	Drivers_Data: Contains information about each driver such as name, ID, and average rating.
 ### Data Claeaning & Transformation
 Performed in Excel using:
 â€¢ Vlookup: To get information from the Drivers_Data into the rides _data
 â€¢ Handling inconsistent data in the date column
 â€¢ Handling nulling values in Promo_code column (Replacing null values with no promo code)
 â€¢ Pivot table for summarizing metrics like: 
   Total Revenue
   Fare by Promo code, city, ride status
   Duration_min by city
   Total Rides
 â€¢ Calculated field for average fare, average duration e.t.c
 ### Analysis & Visualization
